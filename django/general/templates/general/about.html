        <strong>What happens to the connection between collective memory and political identity in the process of migration?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Post-Socialist Britain?</em> takes as its point of departure the growth in support for anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic parties across Europe. Our focus is on post-socialist countries - that is, those with experience of state socialist rule. The support for right-of-centre and xenophobic politics has frequently been explained in these contexts as being underpinned by collective memory of authoritarianism, and/or the ways in which these histories are used by those seeking support for ethnonationalist politics. Nonetheless, those who give such explanations usually assume that those remembering authoritarianism do so in their country of origin. <em>Post-Socialist Britain?</em> breaks out of this national mould to explore if and how memory is linked to political identity when the individual moves to a new national context.
    </p>
    <p>
        Political identity is influenced by a complex web of factors: e.g, constructions of ethnicity, social inclusion, community networks, and media representation. Post-Socialist Britain uses an innovative interdisciplinary methodology to explore this complexity. It uses a case study approach, focusing on two comparable, but very different, groups: Polish and German immigrants in the UK.
    </p>
    <p>
        The research findings of Post-Socialist Britain will lead to a better understanding of how immigrant groups negotiate different aspects of their identities and the factors that contribute to the development of political behaviour. The project will therefore also be of significance for multiple stakeholders who work towards promoting community cohesion and against xenophobia and extremism. We work closely with Polish and German professional and community associations, policymakers, immigrant communities, and schools.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project will result in: a single-authored monograph, a conference and special issue, five peer-reviewed journal articles, stakeholder workshops, two policy briefings, a virtual and physical exhibition and series of artistic performances, school teaching resources, and press op-ed and opinion pieces.

        The research is divided into four strands: Narratives, Networks, Media and Communities
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Narratives</strong> examines the ways in which participants give meaning to personal and collective memories of their countries of origin and how they link these meanings to their political identity and behaviour in the present. The narratives are gathered in a series of one-to-one interviews with Polish and German immigrants to the UK.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Networks</strong> examines the multilayered networks composed of diverse organizations and individuals shaping memory and political identity of Polish and German nationals including the possible impact of local (British) milieus. In this strand we utilize an innovative methodological approach based on Social Network Analysis (SNA). This involves approximately 30 in-depth interviews of selected actors identified as potential brokers using the innovative software VennMaker, which facilitates the mapping of networks through qualitative means.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Media</strong> explores the extent and type of representation of Germany and Poland (especially German and Polish history) as well as of German and Polish immigrants in the UK press and social media. Exploring how the UK press reports on these topics allows us to understand the discursive space in which and against which Germans and Poles in the UK define and develop their political identities and how this might interact with memories of the country of origin.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Communities</strong> explores the ways in which individuals give voice to their memories in dialogue others. Research in this strand centres on series of photography workshops in two urban areas: West Bromwich and Hyson Green. The idea is to foster inter-community dialogue around memories of the past and their connection to the present political moment. The photographs, narratives and recordings of the story exchanges produced in the workshops will form the subject of an exhibition developed by the community in co-operation with Centrala and an Artist in Residence (AiR). Community engagement with the outputs of this strand will be further enhanced by the hosting of the exhibition in Sandwell in July 2023 and the commissioning by project partners Creative Black Country (CBC) of a series of artistic performances (e.g., spoken word, theatre, comedy) around the work.
